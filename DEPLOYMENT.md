# Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Ready for GitHub and Netlify!

Your 3D Floating Shapes project is now cleaned up and ready for deployment.

### What was cleaned up:
- âœ… Removed unused `new.js` file (old vanilla Three.js code)
- âœ… Added static export configuration for Netlify
- âœ… Fixed server-side rendering issues with Three.js
- âœ… Added proper `.gitignore` file
- âœ… Created `netlify.toml` configuration
- âœ… Updated build scripts
- âœ… Tested successful build

## GitHub Upload Steps:

1. **Initialize Git repository:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: 3D Floating Shapes project"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub repository:**
   - Go to GitHub.com
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it: `3d-floating-shapes`
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have one)

3. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/3d-floating-shapes.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Netlify Deployment Steps:

### Option 1: Direct GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Choose GitHub and select your `3d-floating-shapes` repository
4. Netlify will automatically detect the settings from `netlify.toml`:
   - Build command: `npm run export`
   - Publish directory: `out`
5. Click "Deploy site"

### Option 2: Manual Upload
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Upload the `out` folder to Netlify manually
